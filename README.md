So, what's my deal? I've got this personal mission, you could call it a challenge: to explain how cybersecurity works in plain English, or as I like to say, in <b><i>"muggle"</i></b> language. 
<br>
<br>
For over 12 years, I was a technical instructor for big corporate clients, and I can't even count the number of internal training sessions I ran for colleagues across Latin America. I’ve also had the privilege of being a university professor, teaching systems engineering to both undergrads and graduate students.
<br>
<br>
If there's one thing all those years have taught me, it's this: not everyone speaks <b><i>"geek."</i></b> And that's perfectly okay! My goal here, and with other stuff I create, is to cut through the dense technical jargon without losing the important stuff. I genuinely hope that if you're reading this, you feel a bit more confident and can speak up about why understanding cybersecurity is so deeply important these days. It’s not just for the IT crowd anymore; it’s for everyone.
